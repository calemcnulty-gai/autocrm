4. Feature Requirements
4.1 Ticketing System
• Ticket Lifecycle: Must support multiple statuses (Open, Pending, Resolved, Closed/Archived).

• Internal Notes & Collaboration: Agents can append private notes. Mention other agents/supervisors.
• Conversation History: Persist all historical chat/email in one place, easily referenced.
• Bulk Operations: Agents can update status or reassign multiple tickets simultaneously.
4.2 API-First Design
• REST Endpoints & Documentation: CRUD endpoints for tickets, users, knowledge articles.
• Webhooks & Integrations: Configurable triggers for ticket changes or new tickets.
• Granular Permissions: Control access with token-based authentication & role-based scopes.
4.3 Agent Interface
• Queue Management: Provide filterable views by status, team, and priority.
• Ticket Detail: Display conversation timeline, relevant metadata, and real-time updates (WebSockets or Amplify subscriptions).
• Macro/Template System: Predefined responses for common issues.
• Personal Performance Dashboard: Track average response time, resolution rate, etc.
4.4 Administrative Tools
• Team & User Management: Create teams, assign roles, define coverage schedules.
• Skill-Based Routing: Distribute tickets according to agent-specific skill sets.
• Routing Intelligence: Time-based load balancing and rule-based assignment (using custom fields or tags).
• Analytics: Charts or reports covering backlog, resolution times, CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) trends.
4.5 Self-Service & Customer Portal
• Secure Signup/Login: Leverage AWS Amplify's authentication or Supabase Auth.
• View & Update Tickets: Customers can add notes or attachments.
• Knowledge Base & Chatbots: Integrate advanced search (vector search) and AI for quick answers.
• Feedback Loop: Prompt users for feedback after ticket closure.
4.6 Data Management & Storage
• Schema Flexibility: Store custom fields in JSONB columns in Postgres.
• Audit Log: Maintain a thorough change log (create, update, delete events).
• Archival Strategy: Intelligently archive old data to free up resources.
• File Storage: Integrate with AWS Amplify or Supabase to handle file attachments.
4.7 AI/LLM Integration
• Vector Database: Store embeddings for Knowledge Base articles.
• Conversational Context: Provide real-time RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) suggestions for agents.
• Auto-Triage: Potential future functionality to predict ticket priority or routing based on content.
---
5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance
• Responsive UI: Must remain performant on slow or mobile connections.
• Scalability: Architecture should handle growing traffic (leverage Amplify for serverless, auto-scaling).
• Caching: Use in-memory or Redis for frequently accessed data (e.g., knowledge base lookups).
5.2 Security
• Authentication & Authorization: Strict role-based access control.
• Encryption: Use HTTPS/TLS for data in transit; consider SSE (server-side encryption) for data at rest.
• Logging & Monitoring: Ensure consistent generation of logs for security audits and escalations.
5.3 Maintainability
• Modular Codebase: Keep functions small (< 60 lines) and files (< 250 lines).
• Versioned Endpoints: Provide backward compatibility when introducing new functionality.
• Documentation & Comments: Keep code and architecture docs up-to-date for LLM interpretability.

6. Technical Architecture
Below is a high-level architecture outline:
Front End
React 18 + Vite for a modern, fast development experience
Shadcn/ui components (built on Radix UI) for accessible, customizable UI
TanStack Query for data fetching, caching, and state management
React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form handling
Tailwind for responsive design and styling

Backend & Data Layer
Supabase (Postgres & Auth) as primary data store, leveraging JSONB columns for flexible schemas
Real-time subscriptions via Supabase
Type-safe API calls with generated types

AI & Vector Search
Store embeddings for knowledge articles in Supabase.
RAG pipeline that fetches relevant data and surfaces suggestions for Agents.

Deployment & Infrastructure
AWS Amplify for web app hosting, possible usage of Amplify functions for serverless.
Supabase for managed Postgres, authentication if not fully delegated to Amplify.

7. Implementation Roadmap
MVP (Core Ticketing & Basic Portal)
Implement the ticket model (create, read, update, delete).
Basic React/Redux workflow for queue display, ticket detail, and editing.
Supabase integration for data storage.

Internal notes, agent mentions, skill-based routing.
Admin panel for user/team management.
Self-Service & Knowledge Base
Customer portal with ticket creation and FAQ/knowledge base.
Basic AI chatbot or search system.
Advanced Integrations
Webhooks, extended AI features (RAG, vector search).

8. Acceptance Criteria
• Functionality:
Must allow customers to create, track, and close tickets.
Agents can manage queue, collaborate, and provide responses.
Admin functionalities include user/team management, routing, analytics.
• Reliability & Performance:
System must handle a defined volume of API requests per minute with minimal slowdowns.
Real-time updates push new ticket events without requiring manual refresh.
• Security & Compliance:
All endpoints secured with role-based authentication.
Sensitive data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest where applicable.
• Usability:
Agent UI must be intuitive, mobile-friendly, and accessible.
Quick response and minimal onboarding required for new agents.

9. Open Questions & Assumptions
Multi-Language & Time Zones:
Will the system support multiple languages out-of-the-box, or is it planned for a later phase?
External Integrations:
Which third-party services require first-tier integrations (e.g., Slack, Zapier, email providers)?
Compliance Requirements:
Are there industry-specific compliance rules (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) that must be factored in?
SLA & High Availability:
Are there explicit uptime or disaster recovery requirements?
