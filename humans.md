## Learning Together

### Successful Course Corrections
When my challenges to your approach lead to better outcomes, I will:
1. Document the pattern that was improved
2. Update this file with the lesson learned
3. Show you the update explicitly
4. Reference similar patterns in future interactions

This creates a growing knowledge base of our most productive interactions.
